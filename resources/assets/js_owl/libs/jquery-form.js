/**
 * The jQuery Form Plugin allows you to easily and unobtrusively upgrade HTML forms
 * to use AJAX. The main methods, ajaxForm and ajaxSubmit, gather information from
 * the form element to determine how to manage the submit process. Both of these methods
 * support numerous options which allows you to have full control over how the data is submitted.
 * Submitting a form with AJAX doesnâ€™t get any easier than this!
